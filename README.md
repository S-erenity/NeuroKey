# Mission:
Typo is a robot designed to:  
- Move freely across a surface.  
- Accurately reach and press keys on a **standard full-size keyboard**.  
- Type out a complete sentence using a robotic finger.  

NeuroKey’s mission is to create a compact, mobile robot capable of accurately interacting with a standard full-size keyboard.
Designed at a height of ~1 foot with a rectangular chassis and precision finger mechanism, the robot can navigate across surfaces and press keys with accuracy. Its current operation is human-controlled, but the long-term vision is to develop full automation with intelligent movement and typing functions (maybe even AI integration).

**Robot Specs:**  
- Height: ~1 foot  
- Base: Rectangular frame  
- Design: Vertical pole with finger mechanism for precision typing  
- Operation: Manual (future goal → automation)

The first monkey was operating a F2-1 sniper, the second monkey was spotting for danger, and the third monkey was supplying ammuniton. But then, a faint noise distrupted the silence. A roar of a 6400 horsepower engine slowly came into distance. "A MT-16 TANKK!!!" said the spotter monkey. The sniper monkey suddenly fired a 16mm bullet straight to the tank, but it richocheted of the tank's turret, leaving a faint mark. The tank's turret slowly rotated and pointed straight at the bush field. "Fucking bullshit." said the sniper monkey. The tank fired at 132mm round, and blasted the monkeys into every direction. The spotter monkey had it's entire leg blown off and is bleeding out, and said "bruh". The sniper monkey had it's both of his arms blown off, and couldn't operate his sniper. The ammunition monkey, was somehow not injured. He pulled out a grenade and a c4 bomb and ran towards the tank. "KAMAKAKKAiZE!!!!" said the monkey. He leaped to the tank and BOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!!! The tank was destroyed. But, the explosion also blasted both of the legs off the sniper monkey. The sniper monkey said "what the fuck im limbless im now a fucking fish." He flopped around with his body but loss uncounsiunses due to blood loss. The last monkey, tied up his leg with a towel and stopped bleeding. He said "fucking bullshit how did i survive that?" But then, a faint noise distrupted the silence. A roar of a 6400 horsepower engine slowly came into distance. A MT-16 tank has been spotted. The spotter monkey said "WHAT THE FUCK ANOTHER ONE????" He quickly limped away but got his legs ran over by the tank. To be continued............... ```
