# Mission:
Typo is a robot designed to:  
- Move freely across a surface.  
- Accurately reach and press keys on a **standard full-size keyboard**.  
- Type out a complete sentence using a robotic finger.  

NeuroKey’s mission is to create a compact, mobile robot capable of accurately interacting with a standard full-size keyboard.
Designed at a height of ~1 foot with a rectangular chassis and precision finger mechanism, the robot can navigate across surfaces and press keys with accuracy. Its current operation is human-controlled, but the long-term vision is to develop full automation with intelligent movement and typing functions (maybe even AI integration).

**Robot Specs:**  
- Height: ~1 foot  
- Base: Rectangular frame  
- Design: Vertical pole with finger mechanism for precision typing  
- Operation: Manual (future goal → automation)

In 1943, Three monkeys sat on a tree near the battlefield. The first monkey was spotting for danger,the second monkey was sniping, and the third monkey was supplying ammunition. The first monkey suddenly spotted a MT-13 Tank driving in the distance. "FIRE!", said the monkey. The second monkey pulled the trigger and fired a 13mm bullet onto the tank's turret, but it deflected away, leaving a faint scratch. "Fuck." said the spotting monkey. "Go hide right now." All of the monkeys scrambled deep into the tree leaves. But the tank already spotted the movement. It's turret slowly rotated towards the tree. Just about the tank fired, a anti-vehicle rocket was fired within the trees but it missed the tank by a few inches. The tank then fired, exploding the tree into pieces and launching the monkeys into the air. The monkeys landed on the ground, severely injuring them. The ammunition monkey had it's leg completely blasted off and was quickly bleeding out. The monkey yelled "HELP MY LEG IS BLEEDING OUT!" but the other monkeys did not give a shit. The other monkeys rose up with half of their bones broken and ran towards the tank. The spotting monkey pulled out a grenade and stuffed it inside the tank barrel. Just as the monkey was about to celebrate, the tank suddenly fired too, exploding itself along with the monkey. The last monkey said "fucking bullshit." The sniper monkey slowly limped away into the distance...
