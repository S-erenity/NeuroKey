# Mission:
Typo is a robot designed to:  
- Move freely across a surface.  
- Accurately reach and press keys on a **standard full-size keyboard**.  
- Type out a complete sentence using a robotic finger.  

NeuroKey’s mission is to create a compact, mobile robot capable of accurately interacting with a standard full-size keyboard.
Designed at a height of ~1 foot with a rectangular chassis and precision finger mechanism, the robot can navigate across surfaces and press keys with accuracy. Its current operation is human-controlled, but the long-term vision is to develop full automation with intelligent movement and typing functions (maybe even AI integration).

**Robot Specs:**  
- Height: ~1 foot  
- Base: Rectangular frame  
- Design: Vertical pole with finger mechanism for precision typing  
- Operation: Manual (future goal → automation)
